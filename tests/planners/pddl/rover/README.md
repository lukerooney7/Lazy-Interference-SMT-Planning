# rovers

This domain was motivated by the 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions and
the planned 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The objective is to use
a collection of mobile rovers to traverse between waypoints on the planet,
carrying out a variety of data-collection missions and transmitting data back to
a lander. The problem includes constraints on the visibility of the lander from
various locations and on the ability of individual rovers to traverse between
particular pairs of waypoints
