# Depots

A domain used in the IPC-3. It combines the transportation style problem of
Logistics with thewell-known Blocks domain. The Logistics domain exhibits a high
degree of parallelism, since separate vehicles can be utilised concurrently. In
contrast, the Blocks domain is characterised by significant goal interaction.
The intention of the IPC-3 organisers was to discover whether the successes of
planners in each of these domains separately could be brought together when the
problems were combined.
