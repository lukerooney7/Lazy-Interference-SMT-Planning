# Satellite

Adapted for IPC-4 by JÃ¶rg Hoffmann. The domain was introduced by Maria Fox and
Derek Long in IPC-3.  This domain was inspired by the problem of scheduling
satellite obser-vations.  The problems involve satellites collecting and storing
data using differentinstruments to observe a selection of targets.
